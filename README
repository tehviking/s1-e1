Hmm... what API to use... ?

-- RMU SESSION #1 | PROBLEM 1
-- Submissions due 20:00 UTC 2010.09.07

If in doubt about how to submit, see SUBMISSION_GUIDELINES file.

For exercise #1, you'll be doing a bit of web service integration.  Your goal
will be to create some interesting mashup by connecting any web service of your
choosing to twitter, either by creating an automated feed from an external
data source, or a bot which responds in an interesting way to certain kinds
of tweets.

This exercise is pretty open ended, but please follow the guidelines listed below.

== GUIDELINES

1. You can use any Ruby based Twitter libraries you'd like.

2. You must integrate with some external application, preferably one that you
haven't interacted with programatically before.

3. Any service that we all can access via HTTP without paying for it 
is fair game.   Even if you want to do something like use Mechanize to 
scrape a site that  has no defined service API, that'd be acceptable.

4. You should create a new twitter account for testing your bot, and have it
running live to demonstrate it on 9/8.

5. You should use the mailing list to communicate what sorts of bots you are
building. Ideally, no two bots will provide the same featureset.

6. You may look at other bots for inspiration, but do not submit a solution that
simply mirrors something else you found.  Be creative :)

7. You may help each other with the technical aspect of this project, so feel
free to discuss integrating with twitter on #rmu-session-1 or on the mailing
list.  You can also ask folks for help with how to integrate with whatever other
services you want to use.  While your actual submission needs to be your own
work, do not be afraid to ask for help from your fellow students.

Examples:

A bot which tweets all posts to Hacker News:

from here):

== QUESTIONS?

Hit up the mailing list or IRC.

Please note that I am traveling for the next 7 days, and will only have access
to email 9/1, 9/2, and 9/7.  I will try to answer questions during that time,
but please rely on your fellow students for help in between.
